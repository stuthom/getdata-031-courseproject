## Instructions
To use this code, run the file *run_analysis.R* from any local directory.  The code will download the required source data and will place the result in a file named *tidy_dataset.txt* in the same folder.

The file *CodeBook.md* contains more detailed information about the data used and the steps involved in producing the tidy data set.

## Source data and output files
A copy of the source data found at the URL specified in the CodeBook is provided for reference should the data no longer be available at that URL.  To use this data, a copy should be placed locally and named *UCI_HAR_Dataset.zip* and the code amended to skip the file download.

The output file is provided for reference and shows the result of running the code on the specified data set.
